# Prompting Techniques for LLMs:
## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

**Definition:**  
Instruct the LLM to perform a task without examples, relying on its pre-trained knowledge.

**Best For:**  
Simple, well-defined tasks (e.g., classification, translation).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> Classify this customer review as positive, neutral, or negative:  
> "The delivery was fast, but the package was damaged."

**Key Tip:**  
Use clear, concise instructions.

---

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

**Definition:**  
Provide 1–5 examples to demonstrate the desired output format or logic.

**Best For:**  
Complex tasks requiring pattern recognition (e.g., formatting data, style mimicry).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> Convert product titles to ad copy:  
> Title: "Organic Almond Butter 16oz" → Ad: "Creamy, pure organic almond butter—no additives!"  
> Now convert: "Stainless Steel Water Bottle 20oz"

**Key Tip:**  
Ensure examples are diverse and representative.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Definition:**  
Guide the LLM to break down problems step-by-step.

**Best For:**  
Math, logic, or multi-step reasoning (e.g., inventory calculations).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> Calculate restocking time for 500 units if 20 units are sold daily. Explain each step.

**Key Tip:**  
Add phrases like "Let’s think step by step" to trigger reasoning.

---

## 4. Role-Based Prompting

**Definition:**  
Assign a role (e.g., expert, chatbot) to shape responses.

**Best For:**  
Context-specific outputs (e.g., customer support, internal docs).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> Act as a Walmart logistics manager. Summarize key challenges in last-mile delivery.

**Key Tip:**  
Specify tone and expertise level (e.g., "Explain to a new employee").

---

## 5. Self-Consistency Prompting

**Definition:**  
Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most frequent answer.

**Best For:**  
Reducing errors in complex decisions (e.g., demand forecasting).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> Predict Q3 sales for electronics in the Midwest. Generate 3 reasoning paths and choose the consensus.

**Key Tip:**  
Use with CoT for higher accuracy.

---

## 6. Meta Prompting

**Definition:**  
Structure prompts abstractly (e.g., steps, templates).

**Best For:**  
Repetitive tasks (e.g., report generation, coding).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> Follow these steps to analyze customer feedback:  
> 1. Extract key themes  
> 2. Categorize by product  
> 3. Summarize trends

**Key Tip:**  
Use for token efficiency in batch tasks.

---

## 7. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting

**Definition:**  
Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously.

**Best For:**  
Brainstorming or multi-solution problems (e.g., supply chain optimizations).

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> List pros/cons of drone vs. truck delivery for rural areas.

**Key Tip:**  
Combine with role-playing for deeper analysis.

---

## 8. CO-STAR Framework

**Definition:**  
Structured prompts with Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response format.

**Best For:**  
Ensuring comprehensive, tailored outputs.

**Example (Walmart Use):**
> C: Walmart’s sustainability report 2024  
> O: Summarize key initiatives  
> S: Professional but concise  
> T: Neutral  
> A: Corporate stakeholders  
> R: Bullet points, max 150 words

**Key Tip:**  
Ideal for executive briefings.

## Key Takeaways for Walmart

- **Precision Matters:** Specify formats (e.g., JSON, bullet points) for structured data.
- **Context is King:** Provide domain-specific details (e.g., "Walmart’s SKU numbering system").
- **Iterate:** Test prompts with different models (e.g., GPT-4 vs. Claude).
